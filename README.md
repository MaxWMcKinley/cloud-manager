This is just a project I made for my cloud computing class in school.  It is a python based command line program that acts as a tool that could be used to manage servers and vms in a distributed cloud computing system.  Note that this program just "pretends" to be setting up hardware and virtual machines and so forth, it doesn't actually do it.  Although, that functionality could be dropped into this CLI.

There is plenty of work that would need to be done to this before it became actually useful for anything.

Instructions to run:

1. Clone or unzip the repository
2. Change your directory to the P4 subdirectory of the repository
3. Run: "source env/bin/activate"
4. Run: "pip install click"
5. Run: “chmod +x aggiestack.py” (If in a bash shell)
6. Run: “export PATH=$PATH:.”

This should now allow you run the program by typing “aggiestack.py” followed by any commands and options.
